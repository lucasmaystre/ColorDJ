# ColorDJ

A simple Windows Phone 7 app that displays a color according to the position of
your finger on the screen.

On the Windows Phone marketplace (I don't know how long it'll stay there):

I built this for the Microsoft You Make IT Smart challenge 2012. I'm not
especially proud of it - but who knows, maybe someone finds this useful as a
boilerplate.
